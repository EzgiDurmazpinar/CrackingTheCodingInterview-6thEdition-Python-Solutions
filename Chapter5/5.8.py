# A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
# pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8
# (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course,
# can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function
# drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen,intwidth,intxl,intx2,inty) which draws a horizontal
# line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).

    start_offset = x1 % 8
    first_full_byte = x1 // 8


    if start_offset != 0:
        first_full_byte += 1

    end_offset = x2 % 8
    last_full_byte = x2 // 8

    if end_offset != 7:
        last_full_byte -= 1

        screen[y * (width // 8) + b] = int('0xff', 16)
